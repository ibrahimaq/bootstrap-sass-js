# About
This is a generic static Single Page Application with an arbitrary underlying business theme.

## Technologies used
- Bootstrap 5
- SCSS
- JavaScript

## Learning curve
In this project I learnt the most when creating the 'carousel' using vanilla JavaScript. It is slightly different to the usual carousel that is observed on many websites.
The challenge was to think in logical steps whilst producing clean code.

## Things to improve on
- Include more accessible features.
- Add a horizontal progress bar under the the navbar to let the user know how far they have scrolled down the page
